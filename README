Overview

  Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) is a binary data format widely
  used for digital certificates (such as X.509) and telecom billing
  records.

  `Codec.Binary.DER' Haskell library contains functions for decoding
  {XXX_TODO and encoding} DER data.  Decoded values - ASN.1 tags - can
  be written to stdout as S-expressions {XXX_TODO and read back to
  Haskell representation}.

  `under' executable can be used to:
    - decode binary files to plain text S-expressions
    {XXX_TODO
    - pretty-print decoded data
    - obtain domain-specific output, specified by resource files
    - filter DER records (under SRC | grep CRITERIA | under -e > DEST)
    - create custom binary files, etc.}

   ASN.1 encoding rules (BER, CER, and DER) are specified by
   `ITU-T Recommendation X.690':

   asn1c -- ASN.1 compiler by Lev Walkin.  It contains an `unber'
   utility that decodes BER data to XML format.
